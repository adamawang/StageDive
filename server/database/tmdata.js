Big Shot's performance is a 90-minute to two-hour show not to be believed, packed with hit after chart-topping hit in a high energy, interactive stage performance. Don't miss these special guests performing with the band about which Billy Joel himself declared: \"They had a hard time convincing me it wasn't me. It's uncanny.\" His encyclopedic knowledge of the Billy Joel catalog made him a perfect fit as background vocalist and guitarist for BILLY JOEL. He has been performing monthly at Madison Square Garden with Billy & the band.",
