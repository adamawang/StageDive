# StageDive

Stage Dive is a social media web app for music enthusiasts who want to centralize their upcoming concerts, connect with friends, and explore events from favorite artists.

The app makes it easy to track events, follow artists, and connect with friends.
Once you’ve found what you’re looking for, it’ll remain easily accessible from a glance at your dashboard.

Stage Dive was built by three full stack software engineers: Timothy Yin, Sean Ho, and Adam Wang.

Stage Dive uses a relational MySQL database, and is powered by React with Redux on the front end, and Node/Express on the backend.
The Google Maps API was used to provide map views.
StageDive aggregates data from several entertainment API’s including Ticketmaster, Songkick, and Bandsintown.
